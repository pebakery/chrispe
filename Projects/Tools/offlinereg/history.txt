0.9.7
fixed : null string when importing ok
fixed : empty keys with subkeys ok
added : created a blank hive

0.9.8
fixed : import was incorrectly importing multi_sz and expand_sz string
added : getvalue and enumallvalues will report the key type
added : setvalue syntax for reg_expand_sz was missing in the help

0.9.9
added : import will support the @ i.e default value syntax
added : multi level paths are handled by createkey and setvalue (i.e the full path will be created)
added : param after createkey can be empty
added : param after deletekey can be empty

added : x64 version

1.0.0
removed : no more nobackup param - will overwrite original file

added : import will handle multi level paths

1.0.2

fixed : oem function improved
fixed : wrong value in enumallvalues under some circumstances
added : enumkeyr will recursively loop thru a key and its subkeys
added : setvaluebyteat a_reg_binary_value byte offset
added : getvaluebyteat a_reg_binary_value offset
fixed : setvalue error:"..." is an invalid integer on some integer
added : getvalue key " " 255 to display a binary into ascii
fixed : error control in deletekey
fixed : run command will no longer fail on one single error

toto review syntax for deletekey and createkey (no need to open the key first, we can use the api against the hive giving full path)
